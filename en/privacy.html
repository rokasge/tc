   <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when
      you visit TechCompared.com (the "Site").
   </p>
   <h2>Personal information we collect</h2>
   <p>
      When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device,
      including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies

      automatically-collected information as "Device Information."
   </p>
   <p>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>
   <ul style="margin-bottom: 12px">
      <li>
         "Log files" track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address,
         browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
      </li>
      <li>
         "Cookies" are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an

      the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
